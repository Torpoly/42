My Minishell is public so you might actually read this.

This Minishell is beautiful, all Minishells are beautiful.

But it could be better.

Before you start, read the mans for all builtins and remember what is not asked for is not to do and what is undef is undef

If you have never implememted pipex do it, it will save you so much time and sweat.

Regarding the above mentioned tip, I chose not to do it, don't do like I did!

Remember to always check if things exist before you free them and that should be the case especially if you run it with env -i

Also make sure to call your own libft function and not standard ones, I might have forgotten one or two in there!

If you find a way to make my code segfault I would appreciate feedback.
